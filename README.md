MSTU1001: Comparative   Research   Essay Tasksheet
Task   Description
In order to   be eligible to   pass this   piece of assessment, you must   answer   one   of the   essay questions on this tasksheet. Additionally, you must closely   analyse   sequences from two (2) films from the course, and at   least   one   (1)   of these films   must   be from weeks 8-13 of the course.   Do   not choose the film you   analysed for   your Formal Analysis   Essay.
For this assignment, you will choose one of the essay questions   on   this   tasksheet   and write a response to this question in   the   form   of a   research   essay. You   will   answer   the question by incorporating close analysis of film form   and   style   (including   mise-en-scene, cinematography, sound and   editing). Your essay must   have a   central   argument   and make   a claim about how aspects of form   and style   function   together.
As we are asking you to look at two films,   this   argument   should   also   be   comparative   –   you   should compare the form. and style. of one film to the   other as   part   of your argument.   You will   need to compare one (1) clip from each   of the   two   (2) films –   two   (2)   clips   total.
Include the   Kanopy timecodes of these clips in your introduction   paragraphs.   They   should   not   be   more than 2   minutes   long each.
You must use research   to support   your   argument,   consulting   two   (2)   academic   sources   outside of the course readings, and demonstrate your   understanding of the terms   and   concepts   in   Film Art. You   must also use the referencing and formatting   style   stipulated   in   the   17th edition of The Chicago   Manual of Style.
Please do   NOT   include still   images   in your essay.

2.      Stephen   Prince defines   perceptual   realism as the cues that “aim to   persuade   viewers that what they are seeing is real within   the   storyworld   and   is   therefore credible and convincing” (“Reasons for Realism”   56).

4.      How do documentaries represent (or subvert)   notions of truth   or   reality?
Compare a clip from each of the two documentaries   (   This is   Not   a   Film   and      Cameraperson)   in the course and examine   how they invoke   ideas   of truth or   reality through their use of film form. and   style.
